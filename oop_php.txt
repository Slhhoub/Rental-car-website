--> PHP - The __construct Function:
. A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.

--> PHP - Access Modifiers
1 : public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
2 : protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
3 : private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class

--> PHP - What is Inheritance
. Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.
. The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition,
it can have its own properties and methods.
. An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

--> PHP - What are Interfaces
. Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement.

--> PHP OOP - Abstract Classe
. Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks.

--> Diffrent betwen abstract and interface : 
I _ in abstract classes:
1 : You can include method signatures with or without method implementations.
2 : You can also have properties with access modifiers (public, protected, private).
3 : Abstract classes can include constructors.
II _ Interfaces in PHP:
1 : Interfaces can only contain method signatures (method names without implementations).
2 : They cannot include properties with access modifiers.
3 : Constructors cannot be defined in interfaces.
4 : A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all the methods
declared in the interface.

--> Polymorphism in PHP : 
. in PHP refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms and exhibit different behaviors while sharing a common interface.
. It allows different classes to implement the same method name with different functionality.
